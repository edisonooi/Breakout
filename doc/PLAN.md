## Interesting Breakout Variants

I thought vortex was particularly interesting because it flipped the basic
geometry of the Breakout game. It also presents the challenge of having
to account for all 360 degrees of possible directions the ball could fly
away vs just one side for the normal variant.

I also thought Super Breakout was interesting because of the introduction
of powerups or challenges, such as having multiple balls. I particularly
like the idea of multiple balls because it introduces a new degree of
difficulty because of having to keep more balls alive, but also provides
a game advantage by being able to break more bricks in a short time. Having
at least 2 balls is something I definitely would want to incorporate into
my own variation of Breakout.
